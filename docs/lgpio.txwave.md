## txWave() function

This starts a wave on an output group of GPIOs.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function txWave(handle: number, gpio: number, pulses: TxWavePulse[]): number;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  handle | number | The GPIO device handle as returned by [gpiochipOpen()](./lgpio.gpiochipopen.md) |
|  gpio | number | The group leader GPIO number |
|  pulses | [TxWavePulse](./lgpio.txwavepulse.md)<!-- -->\[\] | The pulses |

<b>Returns:</b>

number

The number of entries left in the wave queue for the GPIO group

## Remarks

Each successful call to this function consumes one queue entry.

This command starts a wave of pulses.

`pulses` is an array of pulses to be transmitted on the group.

Each pulse is defined by an object with the following properties:

- `bits` (`bigint`<!-- -->): the levels to set for the selected GPIO - `mask` (`bigint`<!-- -->): the GPIO to select - `delay` (`number`<!-- -->): the delay in microseconds before the next pulse

Another wave command may be issued to the group before the last has finished transmission. The new wave will start when the previous wave has competed.

Multiple waves may be queued in this way.
