## gpioFree() function

This frees a GPIO.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function gpioFree(handle: number, gpio: number): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  handle | number | The GPIO device handle as returned by [gpiochipOpen()](./lgpio.gpiochipopen.md) |
|  gpio | number | The GPIO number |

<b>Returns:</b>

void

## Remarks

Note that the GPIO state will not be reset by this function, so if the GPIO was e.g. an output and its state was high, it will remain so even after it's freed by calling this function.
